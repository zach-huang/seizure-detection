Seizure-Detection Algorithm

See the manuscript for details on how the algorithm works.

The script works by taking in an excel file with time series EEG data. I've lost the orginal data file off my old macbook so currently it doesn't work but it can be adapted to any labelled dataset in an excel file.

NOTE: 
This was the first time I've ever coded an algorithm with <1 year coding experience, so the code is not very efficient. I've been trying to get around to trying to optimize the processes through vectorizing all the operations in C.
